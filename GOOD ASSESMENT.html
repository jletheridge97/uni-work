<h1>Overview:</h1>
<p>For this Assessment I will be trying to create a game, much like Mario I will be making the game with somewhat the same structure using levels and achievements to finish this game. Although Mario is a widely spread and populated game, I will put my twist on things. The goal is to make it to the finish but if you fall you will be sent to another level to try and finish which will let you start from where you left off.</p><img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/332b0b4350a9caff4e1f1d1f23831a44/tenor.gif" width=400 height=400>

<h2>Motivation:</h2>
<p>The game Mario itself is an amazing game but I think the game is to simple. A lot of people will say different but Imagen Mario but with a gulag, the chance to pick up from where you died or have fallen. There will be lots of obstacles in the way but wouldnt it be great to just be able to have fun? Instead of having to restart the levels all over again, it just gets annoying over time and then makes the game not very interesting. The amount of people I have spoken to in the past have loved Mario and other similar games but I always get the same reactions back about dying and restarting, hence why I want to make a game where you at least get the chance to try there levels again.</p> <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/8209e564ab2ab3c7cc51f5a9146558df/tenor.gif" width="200" height="200">

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>The features in this game will include being able to re spawn in an area witch you have died or failed. With the gulag affect it gives you the option to play a quick level to get back to the point where you died or to just go back to the start. Now I know what you're thinking, this game will be boring and it may seem that way at first but the amount of people that will actually want to play this game will have amazing results, this game will be set out in an old fashioned style, just like the olden day Mario seen because being set out like that will attract not only young people but will also attract the likes of older people who had played these sorts of games when they were younger. The aim of this game will be like other games, just try and reach the end of the levels and beat the game. Seems simple enough. But as you progress the levels will get harder but with harder levels you always would love some advantages right? As you go on and complete levels you will get access to all these cool features such as guns to destroy things in your path or abilities like extra jump boost or speed boosts.</p> <img src="https://media.tenor.com/images/7ed918fc11bdc4b1dbf9a24e5f13a08d/tenor.gif">

<h2>Tools and Technologies:</h2>
<p>Well firstly you will need software to make the game run, you will need to spend some time getting the coding right and the animations to all work well so one website I would use is scratch.<a href=” ”>(https://scratch.mit.edu/)</a href=” ”> Scratch is a really cool website for making characters and making them move this is just one of the websites I would use to make a start to my project. I would also use unity as a game making software that would be a great starting point to making this project into a reality. <a href=” ”>(https://unity.com/)</a href=” ”></p> <img src="https://scratch.mit.edu/images/scratch-og.png" width=400 height=200> <img src="https://unity3d.com/files/images/ogimg.jpg?1" width=400 height=200>

<h2>Skills Required:</h2>
<p>Some of the skills required to making a game is the skills to make a character move or to even just make a background move as you are walking along. There is a lot of behind the scenes action when making a game, you could be focusing on making your character then you could be working on what happens in the background while your character is just standing there. You would need someone that is very good with coding and have somebody rather good with software, I don’t think it would be too hard to find someone with the skills to make this game as it is based off another similar game just with some cool changes.</p><img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mariofanon/images/d/d0/HatThrow.gif/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/340?cb=20190824085121">

<h2>Outcome:</h2>
<p>If the project is successful I believe that people of all ages will have a fun feeling about this game! Being an old style game will really bring back some memories, but of course with some twists in the game it will also bring some younger people in to play. So not only is it for the older generation, it can be for the younger generation too.</p> <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTDqBQAi1vPWnjQ4zZ6-UicTaINXr5Zl2bNQwu81AOip99cq_lK&usqp=CAU" width="400" height="450">                                                       <img src="https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F434705%2Fvideo-games-gettyimages-538789362.jpg&w=700&op=resize" width="400" height="450">
